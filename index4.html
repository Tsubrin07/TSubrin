<h4 style="text-align:left;font-size:25px;color:grey;"> Making DIY crafts</h4>
<p style="font-size:20px; color:dark grey;"> The first time I discovered my interest in creating something artistic by myself was when my aunt gifted me a diy ornaments kit. It contained vibrant plastic beads of different shapes and sizes, elastic and inelastic strings; all that is required to design and create your own jewellery. I was extremely excited and tried making various things out of that amazing kit and even gifted those handmade jewelleries to my friends. During festivals, I decorated handmade cards and distributed them amongst all my near and dear ones.Also, I made origami butterflies and stars out of colourful papers and stick them to my wall. I used to spend hours watching youtube and learning new decorations from scraps everyday.</p>

<p style="font-size:20px; color:dark grey;"> This is one of my most favourite hobbies of all time. Being a person who has a sweet tooth; I quickly picked up my interest in baking various delicacies whenever I craved for them. I also watch a lot of reality shows on cooking competition and follow a lot of famous pastry chefs on social media in order to gain motivation and be bewildered by their stunning bakeries. During my spare time, I try to pursue my hobby in baking as much as I can, and I absolutely love it!</p>

<p style="font-size:20px; color:dark grey;"> This is a hobby that I've recently started investing my time in. I was inspired to learn about graphic design from my brother, who shares the same interest as me in this case.In order to hone and pursue my skill I learned to use softwares such as <b> Adobe Illustrator</b> and <b>Adobe Photoshop</b>. I'm still an amature and have a long way to go to be fully efficient in this field.</p>
